# TerrainBuilder2
3D Voxel Terrain Generator (WIP)
![ProjectView](https://i.imgur.com/bMbwhTQ.png)

This project uses a Java 8 version of [FXyz](https://github.com/FXyz/FXyz) that I modified, a library that adds onto the existing components of JavaFX
This project also uses [FastNoise by Auburn}(https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise_Java) to generate the terrain.

The project is 90% done, I just need to add the ability to save & load the terrain that this project creates.

## How to Use:
* Move the camera & zoom with arrow keys and PgUp, PgDn
* After entering the values that you want for the noise you selected, press generate
